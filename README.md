M12.Neos.NodeType.CodeSnippet
=============================

Simple `CodeSnippet` node type for Neos. It just wraps the code snippet into `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`, nothing more.

This is very basic and only temporary solution untill CodeHighlighting node element appears in TYPO3 Neos core. See
